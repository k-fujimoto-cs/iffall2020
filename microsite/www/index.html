His signature restaurant, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea, London, has held three Michelin stars since 2001.

Ramsay is known for presenting TV programmes about competitive cookery and food, such as the British series Hell's Kitchen, The F Word, and Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, the latter winning the BAFTA for Best Feature at the 2005 British Academy Television Awards, and the American versions of Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares, MasterChef, MasterChef Junior, as well as Hotel Hell and 24 Hours to Hell and Back. In 2020, Forbes listed his earnings at $70 million for the previous 12 months, and ranked him the 19th-highest-earning celebrity in the world.</p>
