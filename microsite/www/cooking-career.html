                <h1>Cooking Career</h1>
                <p>Upon his return to London in 1993, Ramsay was offered the position of head chef, under chef-patron Pierre Koffmann, at the three-Michelin-starred La Tante Claire in Chelsea. 
                    Shortly thereafter, Marco Pierre White reentered his life, offering to set him up with a head chef position and 10% share in the Rossmore, owned by White's business partners. 
                    The restaurant was renamed Aubergine and went on to win its first Michelin star fourteen months later. 
                    In 1997, Aubergine won its second Michelin star. 
                    Despite the restaurant's success, a dispute with Ramsay's business owners, who wanted to turn Aubergine into a chain, and Ramsay's dream of running his own restaurant led to his leaving the partnership in July 1998. 
                    He has described the decision to set out on his own as <emphasize>"the most important day of my entire cooking career; the most important decision of my life".</emphasize></p>

                <p> In 1998, Ramsay opened his own restaurant in Chelsea, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, with the help of his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, and his former colleagues at Aubergine. The restaurant gained its third Michelin star in 2001, making Ramsay the first Scot to achieve that feat. 
                    In 2011, The Good Food Guide listed Restaurant Gordon Ramsay as the second best in the UK, only bettered by The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire.</p>
                
                <p>After establishing his first restaurant, Ramsay's empire expanded rapidly. He next opened PÃ©trus, then Amaryllis in Glasgow (which he was later forced to close), and later Gordon Ramsay at Claridge's. 
                        Ramsay has opened restaurants outside the UK, beginning with Verre in Dubai. Two restaurants, Gordon Ramsay at Conrad Tokyo and Cerise by Gordon Ramsay, both opened in Tokyo in 2005. 
                        In November 2006, Gordon Ramsay at the London opened in New York City, winning top newcomer in the city's coveted Zagat guide, despite mixed reviews from professional critics.</p>
