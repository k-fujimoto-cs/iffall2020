        <ol>
            <li>My name is Kelly, and I'm a senior majoring in architecture.</li>
            <li>I'm taking this class because I'm interested in coding and design, and I want more experience in merging the coding/working side of computer science with the use-interaction and design side.</li>
            <li>I have a little bit of experience with html, css, and javascript, and have done some very simple work, but not that much.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn how to design a website that not only to look pretty, but also responds well to user-interaction, and is easy/clear to use.</li>
            <li>I expect that designing for screen has much more user-interaction and responses than paper</li>
            <li>I think that <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google's Search Engine</a> has a pretty effective website design. It is very clear and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I think that <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netfilx</a> is a good example of effective communication. It labels very clearly items on your list, items to continue watching, what is trending around the world, and includes a number of other categories. </li>
            <li>I think that <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> works well as a website because I think it combines clear communication with effective design.</li>
