            <p>I've been cheated by you since I don't know when</p>
            <p>So I made up my mind: it must come to an end</p>
            <p>Look at me now, will I ever learn?</p>
            <p>I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control</p>
            <p>There's a fire within my soul</p>

             <p class="info">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
             <p>Just one look and I can hear the bell ring</p>
             <p>One more look and I forget everything, whoa</p>

             <p class="info">[Chorus]</p>
             <p>Mama mia, here I go again</p>
             <p>My my, how can I resist you?</p>
             <p>Mama mia, does it show again?</p>
             <p>My my, just how much I've missed you</p>
             <p>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</p>
             <p>Blue since the day we parted</p>
             <p>Why, why did I ever let you go?</p>
             <p>Mama mia, now I really know</p>
             <p>My my, I could never let you go</p>

            <p class="info">[Verse 2]</p>
            <p>I've been angry and sad about things that you do</p>
            <p>I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through</p>
            <p>And when you go, when you slam the door</p>
            <p>I think you know that you won't be away too long</p>
            <p>You know that I'm not that strong</p>

            <p>"Bye-bye" leave me now or never</p>
            <p>Mama mia, it's a game we play</p>
            <p>"Bye-bye" doesn't mean forever</p>
